# SmartDuplicateFinder
In this training class we will be creating a WPF duplicate file/directory finder.

## Goal
Finding duplicate files is only the first step. Duplicate files are normally found with other duplicate and closely related files, thus the parent folder may be fully or partially duplicated as well. Therefore, we want to group these files as far up the folder hierarchy as possible.
